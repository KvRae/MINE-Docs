## Map Scene Layout [ðŸ¡•](https://indoor-navigation-lib.bitbucket.io/indoornavigationengine/com.machinestalk.indoornavigationengine.ui/-map-scene-layout.html)

The map scene layout is the main view of the indoor environment, providing users with a visual representation of the map and key features such as pathways, walls, points of interest (POI), and other elements.
it is a combination of the indoor navigation scene, and the other UI components such as the bottom navigation bar, bottom sheet, search bar layout, and current location button.
In the demo below, you can see the map scene layout in action:


Here is a code snippet that shows how to use the map scene layout:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MapScreen(
    context: Context = LocalContext.current,
) {
    val map = MapLoader.loadMapFromAsset(
        context = context,
        fileName = "map.json"
    ) // Load the map from the asset folder

    val databaseHandler by lazy {
        DatabaseHandler(
            PoiRepository(InNavEngineDb.getInstance(context))
        )
    } // Initialize the database handler

    val uiLayoutHandler: UiLayoutHandler = viewModel {
        UiLayoutHandler(mapBuild = map)
    } // Initialize the UI layout handler

    MapSceneLayout(
        mapBuild = map,
