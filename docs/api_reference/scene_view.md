# Sceneview

3D and AR View for Android, Flutter and React Native working with ARCore and Google Filament Engine.
It's a library that allows you to create 3D and AR experiences in your Android, Flutter and React Native applications used in order to create 3D and AR experiences in your applications.
In MINE context, Sceneview is used to display the 3D map and the navigation path in the 3D view.
