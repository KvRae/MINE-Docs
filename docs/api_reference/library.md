MINE is made by a team of interns (Engineers) at Machinestalk. The team is composed of 2 interns who are working on the project for 6 months. One is working on the android library and the other is working on the ios.
Our goal is to create an indoor navigation system that can be used in different applications. 
The project is still in development and is not yet ready for release. We are actively working on improving the library and adding new features to make it more robust and user-friendly.
Stay tuned for updates on the release of the MINE library.
